            <h2>Primary Research</h2>
            <p>
              I performed interviews to obtain additional information on how
              effectively the suggested solution should be constructed for the
              consumers. Through the interviews, I was able to learn about the
              features and services that users want from a health and fitness
              app. Additionally, I also conducted an online survey to obtain
              input and ideas from key user groups. I was able to interview Mr.
              Yeshan Perera and Ms. Natalie Fernando in order to acquire the
              necessary information. They are both highly motivated people who
              are concerned about their health and fitness. Below are some of
              the questions that were asked during the interview.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What type of fitness and health apps have they used?</li>
              <li>What sought of features are they looking for in a fitness and health app?
              </li>
              <li>Have they come across apps that have all in one solution for health and fitness?</li>
              <li>Issues they have faced when dealing with the apps?</li>
              <li>What type of app would they consider worth purchasing?</li>
              <li>How do they select the best health and fitness app for them?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My intended group size for the online questionnaires was 65 people. And I got answers from 50 people.</p>
