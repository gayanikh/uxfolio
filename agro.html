              A digital platform designed to bring healthcare services closer to
              the public. It helps to connect patients with healthcare
              providers, providing them with information on health conditions,
              treatments, and access to telemedicine services. This can help to
              improve access to healthcare, reduce costs, and improve patient
              outcomes.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
              The problem with not having a wellness app is that individuals
              lack an accessible and convenient tool to effectively track,
              monitor, and improve their physical and mental health. This
              results in a lack of self-awareness, poor health management, and a
              hindered ability to make meaningful lifestyle changes. Without the
              ability to track and monitor health data, set and track goals,
              receive personalized recommendations, and access community
              support, individuals may struggle to prioritize their well-being
              and achieve optimal health.

            <h2>
              Overcoming the Hurdles of Success in the<br> Wellness App Industry
            </h2>
            <p>
              Companies operating in the wellness app market face several
              challenges in order to succeed. One of the major challenges is
              related to data security and privacy concerns. Ensuring the
              protection of user data and maintaining compliance with privacy
              regulations is essential in order to build user trust and prevent
              data breaches. Another challenge is competition in the crowded
              wellness app market. With many similar apps available, it can be
              difficult to stand out and differentiate from the competition. In
              addition to these challenges, companies must also ensure that the
              app is user-friendly and accessible to attract and retain users.
              This involves creating a seamless user experience that is easy to
              navigate and intuitive to use, which can be challenging in an
              increasingly crowded market.

            <h2>Primary Research</h2>
            <p>
              I performed interviews to obtain additional information on how
              effectively the suggested solution should be constructed for the
              consumers. Through the interviews, I was able to learn about the
              features and services that users want from a health and fitness
              app. Additionally, I also conducted an online survey to obtain
              input and ideas from key user groups. I was able to interview Mr.
              Yeshan Perera and Ms. Natalie Fernando in order to acquire the
              necessary information. They are both highly motivated people who
              are concerned about their health and fitness. Below are some of
              the questions that were asked during the interview.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What type of fitness and health apps have they used?</li>
              <li>What sought of features are they looking for in a fitness and health app?
              </li>
              <li>Have they come across apps that have all in one solution for health and fitness?</li>
              <li>Issues they have faced when dealing with the apps?</li>
              <li>What type of app would they consider worth purchasing?</li>
              <li>How do they select the best health and fitness app for them?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My intended group size for the online questionnaires was 65 people. And I got answers from 50 people.</p>
